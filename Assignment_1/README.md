## Generator


#### This program generates random double values using three different built-in Java random number generators and analyzes the generated data using descriptive statistics. For selected sample sizes, the program computes the number of elements, mean, sample standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values, and displays the results in a formatted table.


## How to Run?
####  To run the code you need to compile and run the Generator class. The program does not require any user input and produces output directly in the console. However, if you want to use different sample sizes, you can modify the nValues array in the execute() method.
